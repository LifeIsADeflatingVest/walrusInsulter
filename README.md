# Walrus Insulter
Does the word "insulter" exist in a standard dictionary? I don't know and I'm too bored to search. But the name *Walrus Insulter* definitely does, in my dictionary. Obviously for those who know him, Walrus Insulter refers to none other than the supreme overlard [sic] of puns, [my cartoon character Punning Walrus. ](https://blog.homeforfiction.com/2023/10/23/punning-walrus/)

*Walrus Insulter* is a simple JavaScript applet that displays randomly selected grumpy, cynic, and pessimistic quotations from Mr Walrus. It's simple but funny. 

A couple of notes on usage: The code itself as well as the quotations (which were generated with the help of AI, though edited by yours truly) are absolutely free to reuse, copy, modify, etc. etc. It's such simple code that it would be ludicrous to lay a claim on it. **However**, the images of Punning Walrus are my intellectual property and you *cannot* copy and reuse them without permission.
